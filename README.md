# Cynwyd
Cynwyd typeface beta

A neo-grotesque typeface designed for legible signage and wayfinding materials

Betas are presently available for Book and Bold weights. Black weight and italics for all weights are forthcoming.

The beta versions have not been combined into a font family; therefore in some text editors you may need to enable or disable bold weight so the fonts display properly.
