# Cynwyd
Cynwyd typeface beta

A neo-grotesque typeface designed for legible signage and wayfinding materials

Betas are presently available for Book and Bold weights. Black weight and obliques for all weights are forthcoming.

The beta versions have not been combined into a font family; therefore in some text editors you may need to toggle bold weight so the fonts display properly.
